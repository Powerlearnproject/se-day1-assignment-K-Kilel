#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems. Software engineering is important for the creation and maintenance of software systems that power the various aspects of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The key milestones in the evolution of Software engineering include:
1. Development of the various programming languages.
   This started in 1883 when Ada Lovelace created a language to compute Bernoulli's number to the recent ones Python, C##, JavaScript, and Swift among others.
2. Establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline.
   In the late 1960s, Software engineering was recognized as a discipline in the engineering field to create a structured approach.
3. Rise of agile methodologies.
   A new way to manage software development was developed in the 2000s as a response to the earlier complex methods.
   

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle are:
1. Planning and Requirement Analysis
   It involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements. This involves gathering customer inputs and analyzing market surveys.
2. Design Architecture
   This phase is the process of creating high-level and detailed of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation
   This is the process of writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing
   This is the process of performing tests on the software to ensure it meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment
   In this phase, the software is released to the users.
6. Maintenance
   This is the last phase where ongoing support, updates, and enhancements are provided after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology divides a project into distinct phases such as requirements, design and deployment where each phase a specific goal and each phase must be completed before moving to the next one. Ideal for projects with clearly defined requirements with fewer changes such as software for regulatory compliance.

Agile methodology is the iterative and incremental approach focussed on flexibility, collaboration and response to change. It is ideal for projects with frequent changes such as a mobile app where user feedback is integrated frequently. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer develops and executes test plans to ensure software quality.
3. Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples of IDEs include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm and IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) is important for tracking changes to source code and collaborating with a team. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some challenges faced by Software engineers include:
1. Working with tight deadlines.
   The pressure from delivering within tight deadlines can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
2. Changing requirements
   Changing requirements during development can result in project delays and scope creep.
   
To conquer these challenges, it's crucial to employ effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - is testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration testing - is testing the interactions of the different components.
System testing - is testing the whole software.
Acceptance testing - is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions to help get better responses from an AI. The importance is prompt engineering is to assist an AI answer a question much more accurately.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is "Software Engineering". A better prompt is "Tell me about the history of Software engineering." The improved prompt clearly explains that the user would like to understand the history of software engineering.
